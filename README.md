This is all of my python GCSE work 
obviously as this was pre-gcse , i was new and still learning how to use python and these are the very first projects i had made . 
the first 'big' project for me at the time was the ATM machine , whcih now i could do in about 20-30 mins , looking back it was the first thing i had done and i was very proud of it .
this was the main practice for my programming side of the gcse exams . 
looking back i have made signifcant progress from this which is just under 2 years ago now , of which i am now coding a blackjack game with a GUI for my coursework to help gambling addicts transition into sobririty 
instead of going straight cold turkey which has a low success rate. 

all of the other files are simple tasks we were told to do as a starter for a lesson such as the guess the number/dice game , of which i remember that very lesson when i figured out how to use the random fuction built into python and the eurphoria of me 
doing this task correctly and on time for the first time since i had started learning python is something il never forget , and this was the task that kickstarted my desire and love for computer science
